### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm portasynthinca3, obviously. No, I didn't mistake the "password" field for "username". I'm just a random person that kind of knows how to code of all things.

You may know me as the creator of [Yamka](https://yamka.app), a free (both in the sense of freedom and cost) mesaging service. Or [ppfun2](https://github.com/portasynthinca3/ppfun2), a [PixelPlanet](https://pixelplanet.fun) bot. Or [neutron](https://github.com/portasynthinca3/neutron), a home-grown kernel I wrote in C ~~(please don't click on this link)~~. Or a [Discord bot that generates its own messages](https://github.com/portasynthinca3/deuterium). Or maybe you just fund me randomly, who knows. Welcome!

I mainly write back-end code, though I've been starting to shift towards front-end lately, so I guess you could consider me a full-stack developer? Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Please consider [donating some money](https://yamka.app/donate). It's going to go towards maintaining Yamka and Deuterium servers. Thank you.
